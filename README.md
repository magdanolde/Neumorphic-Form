## :shell: PROJECT IN A NUTSHELL

The goal of this project was to practice React Hooks and Styled Components. However, it was also a great opportunity to get to know the principles of neumorphism and put them into practice.

To learn more about this trend, as well as get some inspiration, I read those acticles:

    Neumorphism in user interfaces
    Neumorphism: why it‚Äôs all the hype in UI design
    Neumorphism. The Next Big Thing In UI Design?

I came up with an idea of a pastry shop for this project. In my opinion the aesthetics of a pasty shop or a bakery fit perfectly well to the neumorphism trend.

##  FEATURES & CHALLANGES ###

* Client can customize its own cake by choosing different features.
* At the end to finalize the order, client has to fill in a form. The form is validated.
* The features and the form are placed on three different stages. If the form is filled in correctly, client is redirected to a "thank you" page.
* Client can move easily through different stages, without loosing the entries
* The progression is visualised by a progress bar
*
