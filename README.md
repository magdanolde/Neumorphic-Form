## BAKERY üßÅ

### :shell: PROJECT IN A NUTSHELL

The goal of this project was to practice React Hooks and Styled Components. However, it was also a great opportunity to get to know the principles of neumorphism and put them into practice.

To learn more about this trend, as well as get some inspiration, I read those acticles:

[Neumorphism in user interfaces](https://uxdesign.cc/neumorphism-in-user-interfaces-b47cef3bf3a6)

[Neumorphism: why it‚Äôs all the hype in UI design](https://www.justinmind.com/ui-design/neumorphism)

[Neumorphism. The Next Big Thing In UI Design?](https://opengeekslab.com/blog/neumorphism-the-next-big-thing-ui-design/)

I came up with an idea of a pastry shop for this project. In my opinion the aesthetics of a pasty shop or a bakery fit perfectly well to the neumorphism trend.

### :unlock: FEATURES 

* Client can customize its own cake by choosing different features.
* At the end to finalize the order, client has to fill in a form. The form is validated.
* The features and the form are placed on three different stages. If the form is filled in correctly, client is redirected to a "thank you" page.
* Client can move easily through different stages, without loosing the entries
* The progression is visualised by a progress bar

###  SOLUTIONS APPLIED IN THE PROJECT

* radio buttons & check-boxes
* dropdowns
* css styles are created using styled-components incl. reset style/global styles 
* majority of elements in line with the neumorphism trend
* ES2015+ (arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator) 
* useState React hook

###  SOLUTIONS I STILL WANT TO ADD 

* Mobile & tablet version
